# üß† Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Scans

## Project Overview

This project builds a deep learning system to classify brain tumors from MRI scans into four clinical categories:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

It compares two neural network architectures:
- A **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built specifically for medical image analysis.
- A **ResNet18-based model** using transfer learning for improved performance.

The project integrates **Grad-CAM visualizations** for explainability, enabling medical practitioners to see what regions influenced the model's predictions.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Distinguishes among four tumor types with high accuracy.
- **Dual Architecture Approach**:
  - Custom CNN: Designed for nuanced medical imaging patterns.
  - Modified ResNet18: Leverages pretrained weights with fine-tuned adaptation.
- **Explainable AI**: Grad-CAM heatmaps reveal decision-critical areas in MRI scans.
- **Robust Training Techniques**:
  - Class imbalance handled with weighted loss functions.
  - Extensive data augmentation to simulate real-world imaging variability.
  - Cosine annealing and early stopping for stable convergence.

## Dataset Information

The dataset comprises **5,862 MRI scans**, preprocessed to **224√ó224 resolution** and normalized with ImageNet statistics. Images span multiple orientations (axial, coronal, sagittal) and scanner types.

- **Training Set**: 4,551 images (77.6%)
  - Glioma: 826
  - Meningioma: 822
  - Pituitary: 827
  - No Tumor: 395

- **Test Set**: 1,311 images (22.4%) with similar class distribution.
